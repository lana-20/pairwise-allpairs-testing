# Pairwise Testing or All-Pairs Testing

### Definition

Pairwise testing is a technique for testing combinations of inputs or configurations in a system. It involves generating a set of tests that cover all possible combinations of inputs or configurations, rather than testing each input or configuration individually.

Pairwise testing is often used to reduce the number of tests that need to be run while still providing a high level of coverage. It is particularly useful in situations where there are many combinations of inputs or configurations that need to be tested, as it can help to reduce the time and resources required for testing.

To perform pairwise testing, you can use tools or algorithms that generate a set of tests that cover all possible combinations of inputs or configurations. These tools typically allow you to specify the inputs or configurations that you want to test, as well as the constraints or relationships between them. The tool will then generate a set of tests that cover all possible combinations of inputs or configurations, taking into account the specified constraints.

Pairwise testing can be a useful technique for testing complex systems, but it is not a substitute for other testing techniques such as manual testing or testing with specific scenarios in mind. It is important to use a combination of testing techniques to ensure that a system is thoroughly tested and any defects are identified and addressed.

There are several [tools](https://www.pairwise.org/tools.html) available that can be used to perform pairwise testing.


### Orthogonal arrays in pairwise testing for mobile and web apps

Orthogonal arrays are a type of mathematical design that can be used to generate pairwise test cases for mobile and web apps. Orthogonal arrays are used to minimize the number of test cases needed to cover all possible combinations of input values for a given set of variables.

To use orthogonal arrays in pairwise testing, you first need to define the input values for each feature or functionality you want to test. These input values should be organized into a matrix, with each row representing a different test case and each column representing a different input value.

Next, you can use an orthogonal array tool or calculator to generate a set of test cases that cover all possible combinations of input values using a minimum number of test cases. The tool will use the matrix of input values and the desired coverage level to generate an orthogonal array of test cases.

For example, suppose you have a mobile app with three features, each with two possible input values:

Using an orthogonal array tool, you could generate the following test cases:

This set of test cases covers all possible combinations of input values for the three features using a minimum number of test cases.

Using orthogonal arrays in pairwise testing can be an efficient way to generate a set of test cases that cover all possible combinations of input values for a given set of features or functionalities. However, it is important to note that orthogonal arrays may not cover all possible scenarios or edge cases, and it may be necessary to supplement your orthogonal array test cases with additional test cases to ensure thorough testing.

### Orthogonal vs Decoupled vs Loosely Coupled

Orthogonal, decoupled, and loosely coupled are related terms that refer to the degree to which different components or modules of a system are independent of each other.

Orthogonal refers to the property of two or more variables being independent of each other. In the context of testing, orthogonality can be used to refer to the independence of different test cases or input values. For example, a set of test cases is considered orthogonal if changing the input values for one test case does not affect the results of any other test case.

Decoupled refers to a system in which the different components or modules are completely independent of each other and do not rely on each other for functionality. This can make the system more flexible and easier to modify or maintain, as changes to one component or module are less likely to affect the other components or modules.

Loosely coupled refers to a system in which the different components or modules are somewhat independent of each other, but may still rely on each other to some degree. This can make the system more flexible than a tightly coupled system, but may also make it more difficult to modify or maintain, as changes to one component or module may affect other components or modules.

Overall, orthogonality refers specifically to the independence of different test cases or input values, while decoupled and loosely coupled refer to the independence of different components or modules within a system. A decoupled system is generally considered more flexible and easier to modify or maintain than a loosely coupled system, as the components or modules are completely independent of each other. However, achieving complete decoupling can be difficult in some systems, and a loosely coupled system may be a more practical approach in some cases.

### Orthogonal test cases using different browser versions and plugins as inputs

Orthogonal test cases can be useful for testing the compatibility of a web application with different browser versions and plugins. To generate orthogonal test cases using different browser versions and plugins as inputs, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the browser versions and plugins that you want to test. For example, you may want to test the application with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, as well as with different combinations of plugins.

2. Organize the input values for each browser version and plugin into a matrix, with each row representing a different test case and each column representing a different input value. For example:

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70295997/210122860-ec2fac0a-7895-4a2d-b561-72586e41fe23.png)

3. Use an orthogonal array tool or calculator to generate a set of test cases that cover all possible combinations of input values using a minimum number of test cases. The tool will use the matrix of input values and the desired coverage level to generate an orthogonal array of test cases.

4. Run the generated test cases to ensure that the application is compatible with the different browser versions and plugin combinations.

Using orthogonal test cases can be an efficient way to test the compatibility of a web application with different browser versions and plugins, as it allows you to cover a large number of combinations using a minimum number of test cases. However, it is important to note that orthogonal test cases may not cover all possible scenarios or edge cases, and it may be necessary to supplement your orthogonal test cases with additional test cases to ensure thorough testing.
